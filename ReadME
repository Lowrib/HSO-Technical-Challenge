2. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) - You may find PowerShell hangs for 10-20 minutes. Be patient and let it do it's thing.

3. [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/install) - Use a package manager through IDE command line/terminal. May need authorisation through setting PowerShell execution policy.
npm install pnpm@latest --global
npm install cypress --save-dev
